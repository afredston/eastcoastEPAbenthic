NCCA 2010 Benthic Indicator Status Metadata		
		
"For questions about these data, please contact Hugh Sullivan at sullivan.hugh@epa.gov or use the Contact Us link on the webpage: http://www.epa.gov/national-aquatic-resource-surveys/forms/national-aquatic-resource-surveys-contact-us"		
"It is the responsibility of the end data user to become familiar with the QA codes used in the NCCA 2010 assessment (NCCA_QA_Codes.csv) and review the ""QA_CODES"" column in each dataset to determine whether the data meet quality objectives for specific uses."		
Location information for each site is contained in the SITEINFO File. Use UID as key column for merging data.
