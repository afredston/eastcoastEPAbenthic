NCCA 2010 Water Quality Indicator Status Metadata		
		
"It is the responsibility of the end data user to become familiar with the QA codes used in the NCCA 2010 assessment (NCCA_QA_Codes.csv) and review the ""QA_CODES"" column in each dataset to determine whether the data meet quality objectives for specific uses."		
Location information for each site is contained in the SITEINFO File. Use UID as key column for merging data.		
"For questions about these data, please contact Hugh Sullivan at sullivan.hugh@epa.gov or use the Contact Us link on the webpage: http://www.epa.gov/national-aquatic-resource-surveys/forms/national-aquatic-resource-surveys-contact-us"		
		
UID		Unique Identifier for site and visit number
SITE_ID		Unique NCCA site dentifier
LON_DD		Actual Longitude sampled (decimal degrees)
LAT_DD		Actual Latitude sampled (decimal degrees)
ALBERS_X		X-coordinate on Albers projection
ALBERS_Y		Y-coordinate on Albers projection
PSTL_CODE		State in which sample collection site is located
WTBDY_NM		Waterbody name
RSRC_CLASS		Resource classification
NCCA_REG		Reporting region designations used in the National Coastal Condition Assessment Reports 
GREAT_LAKE		Name of Great Lake within which the site is located (if applicable)
NPSPARK		Name of National Park within which site is located (if applicable)
NEP_NM		Name of National Estuary Program study area within which site is located area (if applicable)
EPA_REG		Identifies EPA Region within which the site is located
STATUS_ALL		Status of sampling at that site.  
TNT_ALL		Target or not Target for sampling
WGT_CATALL		Category used to derive weight for assesment of all parameters except Great Lakes Human Health Fish Tissue Analysis
WGT_SQMI10		Adjusted site weight. USE for all population estimates with the exception of Great Lakes Human Helath Fish Tissue estimates. Units are Square miles.
STATUS_FT		Status of Great Lakes Human Health Fish Tissue sampling at that site.
TNT_FT		Target or not Target for Great Lakes Human Health Fish Tissue sampling
WGT_CAT_FT		Category used to derive weight for assesment of Great Lakes Human Health Fish Tissue Analysis only
WGT_SQMIFT		Adjusted site weight for population estimates of Great Lakes Human Helath Fish Tissue estimates only. Units are Square miles.
CHLA		Surface Chlorophylla (ug/L). Numerical values.
CHLA_COND		Chlorophyll a condition at the site
CHLA_UNITS		Units - Chlorophyll-a as ug/L in water sample
DIN		Surface Dissolved Inorganic Nitrogen (mg N/L). Numerical values. Not listed for Great Lakes sites.
DIN_COND		Surface Dissolved Inorganic Nitrogen Condition at the site
DIN_UNITS		mg N/L
DIP		Surface Dissolved Inorganic Phosphorus
DIP_COND		Surface Dissolved Inorganic Phosphorus condition at the site
DIP_UNITS		mg P/L
DO		Bottom Dissolved Oxygen (mg/L). Numerical values.
DO_COND		Bottom Dissolved Oxygen condition at the site
DO_UNITS		(mg/L)
LIGHT_TRANS		Light Transmissivity; percent of incident light transmitted through onemeter of water. Units: % at 1m depth. Calculated from coefficient of attenuation (Kd): LIGHT_TRANS = exp(-Kd)*100
SECCHI_FINAL		Mean Secchi Depth; used in place of light transmissity in Great Lakes. Units : meters
TRANS_COND		"Ligh Transmissivity condition at the site, based upon LIGHT_TRANS in estuarine sites and SECCHI_FINAL at Great Lakes sites"
CAT_WQI		"Water Quality Index (WQI); Condition by category (Good, Fair, Poor, Missing). At marine sites, the WQI is ased on categorical condition of five component metrics at marine sites (Chla, DIN, DIP, TRansmissivity, & DO), the same protocol used in NCCR IV (pg 15). At Great Lake sites, the WQI is based on only four component metrics (Chla, TP, DO & Secchi), following same rules as at marine sites (NCCR IV pg 15)."
