Target population from the 99-01 time period and the 05-06 time period (which also includes a few 2004 Puget Sound sites), were matched to the target population used for the National Coastal Condition Assessment 2010. "
WGT_56_CAT	"Indicates the categories used to determine the weights. In this case, the two digit state abbreviation for sites that are in the 2005-2006 assessment period"
WGT_NCA_56	Use these weights to obtain the best status estimate for the 2005-2006 time period.
WGT_91_CAT	"Indicates the categories used to determine the weights. In this case, the the two digit state abbreviation for sites that are in the 1999-2001 assessment period"

CHG_PERIOD	Identifies the change period the site belongs in.
CH9156_USE	Identifies whether to use this site in a change analysis between the two time periods 1991-2001 and 2005-2006.

"Note -- these sites constitute a subset of all National Coastal Assessment sites sampled between 1999 and 2006.   These sites represent two time periods -- 1999-201; and 2005-2006 (with a few 2004 Puget Sound sites to round out coverage) that equate to the same target population as used in the National Coastal Condition Assessment 2010.  Once the 2010 data are available, this subset of sites will be used for change analysis between all three time periods."
