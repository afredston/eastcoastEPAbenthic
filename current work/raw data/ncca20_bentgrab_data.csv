The sediment grain size (large sand) was mostly larger than the sieve, so most of the material would end up in jars. We determined that we would have to fill at least 20 jars to capture all our sample. We didn't have enough spare bottles and formalin for this sample and the other two sites for the week. Therefore, after consulting others, we stopped sieving and let go of our sample. For future samples like this, we will explore using a larger sieve size (pending Hugh's reply) and/or sampling in a shallower area where grain size tends to be smaller. This site was deep, in the channel, and exposed to regular fast flows, hence why grain size was so large. We decided not to submit the jars we had filled already, because we didn't know the percentage of sample remaining and this would've been a non-random sub sample.",
